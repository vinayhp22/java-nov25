Datatype can be defined as
1. The kind of data a variable can hold like Integers, floating-point numbers, String or Objects
2. The range of data a variable can store like for byte(-128 to 127)
3. The operations that can be performed on that data like arithmatic operations for integers or floating-point
4. The amount of memory allocated for storing that data like int(4bytes)

There are 2 types of Datatypes
i. Primitive Datatypes
	- stores data directly to the memory(stack)
	- predefined by Java lang
	- There 8 types of Primitive data types
		1. byte - 1byte - -128 to 127 - handling raw binary data : File operations, Network Data Tranfer
		2. short - 2bytes - rarely use in modern programing
		3. int - 4bytes - most commonly : default, good balance b/w range & size
		4. long - 8bytes - whenever int's range is not sufficient & memory optimization is not imp
		5. float - 4bytes - 5-6 decimal places - memory optimization is critical & moderate precision/accuracy
		6. double - 8bytes - 14-15 decimal places - high precision/accuracy & memory optimization is not imp
		7. char - 2bytes - 0 to 65535 - a single 16 bit unicode characters
		8. boolean - ND, JVM dependent, typically 1bit enough but JVM allocates 1byte or more to store true/false
ii. Reference Datatypes
	- stores only reference(address of memory) of data
	- user defined(developers will define)
	- Exs: String, Array, Classes/Objects
