Data type defined as
1. The kind of data a variable can store.
2. The range of data a variable can hold.
3. The opeartions that can be performed on that data
4. The amount of memory allocated to store that data.

Primitive
	- stores data directly in the memory(Stack)
	- Stores data and refernce both in Slack Frame of the method
	- predefined - size, range, kind of data
	- Ex: int byte

Reference/Non-primitive/Object types
	- stores only refernce(address of the memory) of the data in the memory
	- stores only refernces in Stack frame, Data will store in Heap becaues of object types
	- user-defined
	- Ex: String, Array, Objects
	
byte	
	size: 1byte/8bits
	range: -128 to 127
	usage: Byte is best when handling raw-binary data
			1. File opeartions(read/write bytes)
			2. Network Data transfer(streams)

short
	size: 2bytes/16bits
	range: -32768 to 32767
	usage: We rarely use in modern programming
		1. Originally we're using 16bit processors like Intel 8086, 
		2. nowadays, we are using 32/64 bit processors
		3. Whenever we need memory optimization that time we can use short.

int 
	size: 4bytes/32bits
	range: -2^31 to 2^31-1
	usage: Most commonly use in modern programming
		1. Default data type for all integers
		2. Offers a good balance between range & memory usage.
		3. Efficiently handled by modern 32bit & 64 bit processors
		
long
	size: 8bytes/64 bits
	range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
	usage: Use when int range is not sufficient to store large interger values like mobile numbers
	must and should use prefix as L or l.
	
float
	size:  4bytes/32bits
	range: -3.4e38 to 3.4e38(-3.4 * 10^38 to 3.4 * 10^38)
	accuracy: 5-6 decimal places
	precision: single precision
	how to represent: use prefix f/F
	Usage: When memory optimization is critical & moderate precision is okay


double
	size: 8bytes/64bits
	range: -1.7e308 to 1.7e308(-1.7* 10^308 to 1.7* 10^308)
	accuracy: 14-15 decimal places
	precision: double precision
	how to represent: use prefix d/D/no prefix becauese default type all decimal numbers
	Usage: When more precision is needed, like Calculations

boolean:
	size: not precisely defined in Java(JVM dependent)
			- Typically/conceptually  1bit 
			- But stored as 1 Byte or more
	range: NA - can only be true or false
	usage: To store logical values and control program flow in conditional statements and loops.
	- Java enforces type safety - interger cannot converted to boolean. 
	- This avoids many logical problems that we're facing in C/C++.

	
Task:
Declare and assign 10 different values 
to all primitive(except char) and print.
