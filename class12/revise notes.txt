Datatype
1. The kind of data a variable can be store.
2. The range of data a variable can hold.
3. The operations that can be performed on that data.
4. The amount of memory allocated to store that data.

Primitive
	- Stores values directly in the memory(Stack)
	- predefined
	- Ex: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

Reference
	- Stores only references(Stack) of data or values(Heap) in the memory
	- Userdefined
	- Ex: String, Array, Objects
	
byte:
	size: 1byte/8bits
	range: -128 to 127
	usage: handling raw binary data ex: File operations(read/write bytes)
										Network Data Transfer(streams)

short:
	size: 2bytes/16bits
	range: -32768 to 32767(-2^15 to 2^15-1)
	usage: Rarely use in modern programing
	- originally used for 16-bit processor like Intel 8086
	- But today we are using 32/64bit processors
	- If need memory optimization is crictical
	
int:
	size: 4bytes/32bits
	range: -2^31 to 2^31-1
	usage: We commonly use in modern programing
		- default type for all integers
		- good balance between range and memory size

long 
	size: 8bytes/64bits
	range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
	usage: Whenever the range of int is not sufficent, that time can use long
	- must and should use l/L if the int value is out of range for int
	
float
	size: 4bytes/32bits
	range: -3.4E38 to 3.4E38(-3.4*10^38 to 3.4*10^38)
	accuracy: 5-6 decimal places
	precision: single precision
	usage: When we need moderate precision & memory optimization is crictical.
	
double:
	size: 8bytes/64bits
	range: -1.7e308 to 1.7e308
	accuracy: 14-15 decimal places
	precision: double precision
	usage: When we need high precision and not worried about memory optimization
				ex: Calculations

boolean:
	size: In Java, not accurately defined, JVM depedent
			(typically or conceptuallu 1bit, but JVM min 1byte or more)
	range: NA - true/false
	usage: conditional statements
